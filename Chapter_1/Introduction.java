// We understand the basic elements of algorithms, the importance of algorithm analysis.

// 1.1 Variables.
/* Before getting in to the definition of Variables, let us relate them to an old mathematical equation.
   Many of us would have solved many mathematical equations since childhood. As an example, consider the
   equation below:
                                  x^2 + 2y - 2 = 1

   The important thing that we need to understand is that the equation has names (x and y) which hold values
   (data). That means the name (x and y) are placeholders for representing data. Similarly, in computer
   science programming we need something for holding data, and variables in the way to do that.

// 1.2 Data Types.
/* Data type is the name used in computer science programming for this purpose. A data type in a programming
   language is a set of data with predefined values. Examples of data types are: integer, floating point, unit
   numbers, character, string, etc.

   There are two types of Data types:-
   a. System-defined data types(also called Primitive data types).
      Data types that are defined by system are called primitive data types. The primitive data types provided
      by many programming languages are: int, float, char,double, bool, etc. The numbers of bits allocated for
      each primitive data type depends on the programming languages, the compiler and the operating system.

   b. User-defined data types.
      Most programming languages allow the users to define their own data types, called - defined data types.
      For example:- classes in Java.

// 1.3 Data Structure
/* Data Structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
   A data structure is special format for organizing and storing data. General data structure types include arrays,
   files, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs and so on.

   Depending on the organization of the elements, data structures are classified into teo types :-
   a. Linear data structures:- Elements are accessed in a sequential order but it is not compulsory to store all
      elements sequentially (say Linked Lists). Examples: Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues.
   b. Non-Linear data Structures:- Elements of this data structure are stored/accessed in a non-linear order.
      Examples: tress and graphs.

// 1.4 Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
/* The process of solving problems, we combine the data structures with their operations and we call this Abstract
   Data Types (ADTs). An ADT consists of two parts:
   1. Declaration of Data
   2. Declaration of operations

   Commonly used ADTs includes: Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Priority Queues, Binary Trees, Dictionaries, Disjoint
   Sets(Union and find), hash tables, Graphs, and many others. for example, stack uses a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)
   mechanism while storing the data in data structures. The last element inserted into the stack is the first element
   that gets deleted.
   Common operations are: creating the stack, push an element onto the stack, pop an element from the stack, finding
   the current top of the stack, finding the number of elements in the stack, etc.

// 1.5 What is an Algorithm?
/* An algorithm is the step-by-step unambiguous instructions to solve a given problem.
   In the traditional study of algorithms, there are two main criteria for judging the merits of algorithms:
   correctness(does the algorithm give solution to the problem iin a finite number of steps?) and efficiency(how much
   resources in terms of memory and time) does it rake to execute it.

   NOTE:- we do not have to prove each step of the algorithm.

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// 1.6 Why the analysis of Algorithms
/* Algorithm analysis helps us to determine which algorithm is most efficient in terms of time and space consumed.
 */

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// 1.7 What is Running Time Analysis?
/* It is the process of determining how processing time increases as the size of the problem (input size) increases.
   Input size is the number of elements in the input, and depending on the problem type, the input be of different types.
   1. Size of an array.
   2. Polynomial degree.
   3. Number of elements in a matrix.
   4. Number of bits in the binary representation of the input.
   5. Vertices and edges in a graph.
